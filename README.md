These files illustrate how to implement the nonresponse correction from Harris, Eckhardt, and Goldfarb, 2025. The paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17693.

There are 3 files.

1. Selection_In_Surveys_Example.do
Generates a synthetic version of the Norway in Corona Times survey using estimates reported in "Selection in Surveys: Using Randomized Incentives to Detect and Account for Nonresponse Bias" available at https://www.nber.org/papers/w29549.

2. Simulated_Example_continuous.do
Generates a selectively observed continuous survey variable and performs our nonresponse correction, as well as diagnostic tests.

3. Simulated_Example_binary.do
Generates a selectively observed binary survey variable and performs our nonresponse correction, as well as diagnostic tests.
